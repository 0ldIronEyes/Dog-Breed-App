|Goal        |     The goal of this site is to provide  users with a way to narrow down what types of dog breads they would be intrested in adopting. Once the breed types are narrowed down users can search their city to see if there are any available to adopt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         |
| Users       | Prospective pet owners                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         |
| Data        |Using the DogBreedDB Api to collect information about dog breeds, narrowing it down based on different criteria. Also using petfinder for looking up available pets to adopt in the area.|         |

# Breaking down your project

Home Page: Displays your current list of favorite dog breeds if any. 
Dog Breeds are displayed in a vertical list, with columns for fur color, average life expectancy, energy levels, average weight, average size, country of origin

Search for Breeds button at top to go to search page.


Search Page:  Has tabs where you can search by name, or by criteria like size, energy, life expectancy, weight. Once submitted, uses  dog breedDB api to fetch information. Returns a list of dog breeds with name and icon. Can click on any of these breeds to go to details page.

Details Page:  Displays detailed info on dog breed. Name, description, fur color, average life expectancy, energy levels, average weight, average size, country of origin. 
Star button, can click to add it to your favorites list if not already added. 

Search Available:  Can enter a US state.  Will return all available adoptable pets of that breed in the state. 


## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Hereâ€™s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Stretch Goal      |
